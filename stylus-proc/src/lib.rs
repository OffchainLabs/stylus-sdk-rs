///
/// The above will expand to equivalent definitions in Rust, with each structure implementing the [`StorageType`]
/// `trait`. Many contracts, like [the ERC 20 example][erc20], do exactly this.
///
/// Because the layout is identical to [Solidity's][solidity], existing Solidity smart contracts can
/// upgrade to Rust without fear of storage slots not lining up. You simply copy-paste your type definitions.
///
/// Note that one exception to this storage layout guarantee is contracts which utilize
/// inheritance. The current solution in Stylus using `#[borrow]` and `#[inherits(...)]` packs
/// nested (inherited) structs into their own slots. This is consistent with regular struct nesting
/// in solidity, but not inherited structs. We plan to revisit this behavior in an upcoming
/// release.
///
/// Consequently, the order of fields will affect the JSON ABIs produced that explorers and tooling might use.
/// Most developers don't need to worry about this though and can freely order their types when working on a

/// with [`#[payable]`][payable], or else calls to it will revert. This is required as a safety measure
/// to prevent users losing funds to methods that didn't intend to accept ether.
///
/// # Constructor
///
/// Constructors provide a standard way to deploy, activate, and initialize a stylus contract atomically. Without
/// them, it isn’t possible to guarantee that the Stylus contract initialization code will be executed before
/// other methods. When using Stylus constructors, cargo-stylus sends a transaction to a proxy-contract called
/// StylusDeployer that performs all necessary steps.
///
/// The constructor function must be annotated with the `#[constructor]` attribute. It can have any name, but it
/// is advisable to call it `constructor`. There must be no constructor definition or a single constructor for a
/// contract. Like Solidity, function overloading for constructors is not supported. Constructors may be
/// annotated with the [`#[payable]`][payable] attribute if they are supposed to receive Ether.
///
/// The SDK does not automatically call the constructor of inherited contracts. You must explicitly call them in
/// the child contract constructor. If the child contract doesn't define a constructor, the SDK won't attempt to
/// call the parent contract constructor.
///
/// The constructor must receive the self parameter, and it can have any number of other parameters. The values
/// for these parameters will be passed to the constructor when deploying the contract. The constructor should
/// return no value or a result value with a unit type and a vector of bytes (`Result<(), Vec<u8>>`). If the
/// constructor returns an error, the deployment will revert.
///
/// The SDK will ensure the constructor is called only once. To do so, it will wrap the constructor with a
/// function that reads and writes to a specific slot in storage. When called, the constructor wrapper will check
/// the contents of the specific slot and revert if it is different from zero. Then, after executing the
/// constructor method, the wrapper will write a value to the specific slot, ensuring the next call to the
/// constructor will revert.
///
/// ```
/// # extern crate alloc;
/// # use stylus_sdk::storage::StorageAddress;
/// # use stylus_proc::public;
/// # use alloy_primitives::Address;
/// # struct Contract {
/// #     owner: StorageAddress,
/// # }
/// #[public]
/// impl Contract {
///     #[constructor]
///     pub fn constructor(&mut self, owner: Address) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
///         self.owner.set(owner);
///         Ok(())
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In the example above, the constructor receives a single parameter: the address of the contract's owner. Note
/// that we shouldn't use `self.vm().msg_sender()` because that will return the address of StylusDeployer.
/// Instead, we explicitly pass the address of the contract's owner.
///
/// # [`pure`][pure] [`view`][view], and `write`
///
/// For non-payable methods the [`#[public]`][public] macro can figure state mutability out for you based
/// on the types of the arguments. Functions with `&self` will be considered `view`, those with
/// `&mut self` will be considered `write`, and those with neither will be considered `pure`. Please note that
/// `pure` and `view` functions may change the state of other contracts by calling into them, or
/// even this one if the `reentrant` feature is enabled.
///
/// Please refer to the [SDK Feature Overview][overview] for more information on defining methods.
///
/// # Inheritance, `#[inherit]`, and `#[borrow]`
///
/// Composition in Rust follows that of Solidity. Types that implement [`Router`], the trait that
/// [`#[public]`][public] provides, can be connected via inheritance.
///
/// ```
/// # extern crate alloc;
/// # use alloy_primitives::U256;
/// # use stylus_proc::{entrypoint, public, storage};
/// # use stylus_sdk::prelude::*;
/// # #[entrypoint] #[storage] struct Token { #[borrow] erc20: Erc20, }
/// #[public]
/// #[inherit(Erc20)]
/// impl Token {
///     pub fn mint(&mut self, amount: U256) -> Result<(), Vec<u8>> {
///         // ...
/// #       Ok(())
///     }
/// }
///
/// #[storage] struct Erc20;

///         // ...
/// #       Ok(U256::ZERO)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Because `Token` inherits `Erc20` in the above, if `Token` has the [`#[entrypoint]`][entrypoint], calls to the
/// contract will first check if the requested method exists within `Token`. If a matching function is not found,
/// it will then try the `Erc20`. Only after trying everything `Token` inherits will the call revert.
///
/// Note that because methods are checked in that order, if both implement the same method, the one in `Token`
/// will override the one in `Erc20`, which won't be callable. This allows for patterns where the developer

/// want to without modifying the imported `Erc20` type.
///
/// Stylus does not currently contain explicit `override` or `virtual` keywords for explicitly
/// marking override functions. It is important, therefore, to carefully ensure that contracts are
/// only overriding the functions.
///
/// Inheritance can also be chained. `#[inherit(Erc20, Erc721)]` will inherit both `Erc20` and `Erc721`, checking
/// for methods in that order. `Erc20` and `Erc721` may also inherit other types themselves. Method resolution
/// finds the first matching method by [`Depth First Search`][dfs].
///
/// Note that for the above to work, Token must implement [`Borrow<Erc20>`][Borrow] and
/// [`BorrowMut<Erc20>`][BorrowMut]. You can implement this yourself, but for simplicity,
/// [`#[storage]`][storage] and [`sol_storage!`][sol_storage] provide a
/// `#[borrow]` annotation.
///
/// ```
/// # extern crate alloc;
/// # use stylus_sdk::prelude::*;
/// # use stylus_proc::{entrypoint, public, sol_storage};
/// sol_storage! {
///     #[entrypoint]
///     pub struct Token {
///         #[borrow]
///         Erc20 erc20;
///     }
///
///     pub struct Erc20 {
///         uint256 total;
///     }
/// }
/// # #[public] impl Token {}
/// # #[public] impl Erc20 {}
/// ```
///
/// In the future we plan to simplify the SDK so that [`Borrow`][Borrow] isn't needed and so that
/// [`Router`] composition is more configurable. The motivation for this becomes clearer in complex
/// cases of multi-level inheritance, which we intend to improve.
///
/// # Exporting a Solidity interface
///
/// Recall that Stylus contracts are fully interoperable across all languages, including Solidity.
/// The Stylus SDK provides tools for exporting a Solidity interface for your contract so that others
/// can call it. This is usually done with the cargo stylus [CLI tool][cli].
///
/// The SDK does this automatically via a feature flag called `export-abi` that causes the
/// [`#[public]`][public] and [`#[entrypoint]`][entrypoint] macros to generate a `main` function
/// that prints the Solidity ABI to the console.
///
/// ```sh
/// cargo run --features export-abi --target <triple>
/// ```
///
/// Note that because the above actually generates a `main` function that you need to run, the target
/// can't be `wasm32-unknown-unknown` like normal. Instead you'll need to pass in your target triple,
/// which cargo stylus figures out for you. This `main` function is also why the following commonly
/// appears in the `main.rs` file of Stylus contracts.
///
/// ```no_run
/// #![cfg_attr(not(feature = "export-abi"), no_main)]
/// ```
///
/// Here's an example output. Observe that the method names change from Rust's `snake_case` to Solidity's
/// `camelCase`. For compatibility reasons, onchain method selectors are always `camelCase`. We'll provide
/// the ability to customize selectors very soon. Note too that you can use argument names like "address"
/// without fear. The SDK will prepend an `_` when necessary.
///
/// ```solidity
/// interface Erc20 {
///     function name() external pure returns (string memory);
///
///     function balanceOf(address _address) external view returns (uint256);
/// }
///
/// interface Weth is Erc20 {
///     function mint() external payable;
///
///     function burn(uint256 amount) external;
/// }
/// ```
